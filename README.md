# WorklistEditor
Program built to make simple changes to csv files to run them on LCMS instruments.
The files will need to be loaded onto a flashdrive designated with F:\\. This is temorary and will be fixed to search for files in the out folder, right now it is the only way I can isolate it for testing without implementing folders on the shared drive or affecting actual worklists.
Extract the zip folder contents to a flashdrive and drag the worklist_editor.exe file out of the worklisteditor-master folder.
Any CSV file that you want to be edited needs to be placed onto the flashdrive and then the program can be executed.
