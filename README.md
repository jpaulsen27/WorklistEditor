# WorklistEditor
program built to make simple changes to csv files to run them on LCMS instruments.
The files will need to be loaded onto a flashdrive designated with F:\\. This is temorary and will be fixed to search for files in the out folder, right now it is the only way I can isolate it for testing without implementing folders on the shared drive or affecting actual worklists. 
Any CSV file that will be edited needs to be placed onto the flashdrive and then the program can be executed.
