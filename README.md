# WorklistEditor
program built to make simple changes to csv files to run them on LCMS instruments.
The files will need to be loaded onto a flashdrive designated with F:\\. This is temorary and will be fixed in a later update. 
Any CSV file that will be edited needs to be placed into two places. In the included out folder as a stand-in for the out folder on the shared drive and in the worklist editor folder to allow the script to execute.
